## BitVector

This is a fun implementation of a space-optimized data structure for storing a 
collection of `Bool`s using a single bit for each `Bool` value.

Thanks to the default implementations that come with `RandomAccessCollection` in
the standard library, this codebase is quite small, but could probably be
optimized for certian access patterns.
